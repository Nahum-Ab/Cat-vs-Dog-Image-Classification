# Cat vs Dog Image Classification using SVM

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset of images and can predict whether a given image contains a cat or a dog.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify images of cats and dogs. The model uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which is well-suited for binary classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Dogs vs. Cats** dataset from Kaggle. You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).
